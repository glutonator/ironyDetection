@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters Oh well if Jesse Watters said it then it must be true.  #sarcasm

So them pussy them stay.....when you on top, you think only these top problems are your concentrate. "The national budget is blast, blaaa, blaaa". Meanwhile in your one freaking house, you got your people suffering. Capitalism is great #sarcasm! https://t.co/hM0PTrQgyh
Why is Trump’s legal team saying they won’t release their rebuttal to the Mueller report until after it is released?  Don’t they want to get out ahead of it? #sarcasm

@Say_Non_Now Everything she said was a lie @IlhanMN ‘It doesn’t matter how good you are’ so inspirational #Sarcasm Muslims get respect and aren’t not sent to the principles office for nothing more than any kid. Her speech is divisive. She should be ashamed. Her speech is hard to listen to.
@SohrabAhmari @GrayConnolly How dare anyone here suggest buying and having is not the same thing! Hate speech! #sarcasm
Tactical master stroke from Ole. That defense from ManUtd will make BAR players complacent. Valverde may sub Messi on 1st minute and may play an U12.  #BARMUN #MUFC #sarcasm
@KurtSchlichter Well, he does have 60 followers. #sarcasm
In midst of elections #Russia has awarded highest civilian honour to @narendramodi I am expecting #Congress to rush to #ElectionCommission seeking ban on this award as its likely to influence voters and disturbs level playing field. #JustSaying #Sarcasm https://t.co/egKI5NdN5x

@Nigel_Farage Nigel I’m on your side mate and hates everyone who looks and sounds different. If we had a hugely annoying remoaner 2nd ref, leave would win by 98%! We would thrive on WTO terms and take back to the seas to reclaim the empire.... #sarcasm
Took my car to the shop today to have my brakes inspected... when the mechanic called to say I needed new back brakes then asked if I wanted them to fix them.. my response was yeah I kinda like it when my car stops. #YeahImNotSarcasticAtAll #sarcasm #sorrynotsorry

@HoundiousPrime @leovanipayseur Ok , maybe he was using the phrase “absurd conspiracy” sarcastically. Then he should use the #sarcasm hashtag.

@RoKhanna We can only pay for the things Americans need if the wars stop. But then the defense contractors (and politicians) won’t be able to make sky-high profits. I mean, I’m totally fine with my tax dollars going to them (and Amazon, etc. as refunds). What’s the problem? #Sarcasm

@TheEHive_ Wait! What you’re saying is that it takes a team effort and WRs actually catching passes that hit you in the hands & chest to win? Also, I thought it was up to Eli alone to prevent the OL from missing blocks. Are you saying that the Eli haters are lying? #GiantFanimal #sarcasm
