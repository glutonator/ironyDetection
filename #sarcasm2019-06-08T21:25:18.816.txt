@mjguff @PeteToms I’ll say your addition falls into pricing which would absolutely be something to add. But to say things like blackouts aren’t a problem... come on. Also, the list is perfect. The writer makes no errors in anything he does. #sarcasm
@SmokeyLaPonish @realDonaldTrump Yes, the unfounded assumption that anyone criticizing you does not also fight for the specific issues you identify is definitely justification for slut shaming. Good job. Excellent logic.  #sarcasm
